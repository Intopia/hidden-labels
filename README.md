# Accessible hidden labels

Demo version: https://intopia.github.io/hidden-labels/

In some cases, it may not be desirable to display a text label associated with a form control. An example might be a site-wide search form that is positioned within the site header. Even if a text label is not displayed, some sort of label should be available for screen readers.

This repo tests 4 different cases.
